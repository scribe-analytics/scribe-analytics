        <article><h1>Scribe Analytics</h1>

<p>Scribe Analytics is a client-side JavaScript library designed to capture all interaction data into a user-defined, pluggable back-end.</p>

<p>The driving philosophy behind Scribe Analytics is that you can&#39;t ask questions over data that you didn&#39;t capture.</p>

<p>So Scribe captures everything. All the time. With no custom coding required.</p>

<h1>Scope</h1>

<p>Scribe Analytics tracks virtually every user interaction possible.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Page views</strong> &amp;mdash; Every page view event is captured, together with 
information on the browser, referrer, platform, and much more.</li><li><strong>Clicks</strong> &amp;mdash; Every click event will be captured, including information
on the element that is clicked (id, title, data attributes, unique css 
selector). If a link is clicked, then then information on the link target
will be captured, as well.</li><li><strong>Engagements</strong> &amp;mdash; Every engagement with any HTML element in a document
is captured, including information on the element (id, title, data 
attributes, unique css selector). Engagement is defined as a mouseover 
inside a certain time window (e.g. 1 and 20 seconds). Mouseovers outside
the time window are not counted as engagements.</li><li><strong>Jumps</strong> &amp;mdash; Every jump (defined as navigation inside a page which 
results in a change to the URL hash) is captured, including information on 
the element that was jumped to (id, title, data attributes, unique css 
selector).</li><li><strong>Forms</strong> &amp;mdash; All form interaction, including form abandonment and form
submission, is captured, including details on all form fields that are not 
marked as passwords and which have not turned off auto-complete (via the 
<em>autocomplete</em> property). Forms interaction inside iframes will not be captured.</li><li><strong>Redirects</strong> &amp;mdash; Scribe will attempt to capture JavaScript redirects,
but if the user is redirected to another site, and never returns, the 
redirect may not be captured.</li><li><strong>Reloads</strong> &amp;mdash; All page reloads are captured. A reload occurs whenever
the page is refreshed, either by the user or programmatically.</li></ul>

<p>Scribe Analytics will capture clicks on links and form interaction even when 
those links and forms are added dynamically via JavaScript. This is extremely
important in modern websites because so much content is inserted dynamically.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<ol><li><p>Include the Scribe Analytics module inside your HTML pages.</p><p><code>html
&lt;script type=&quot;application/javascript&quot; src=&quot;scribe-analytics.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></p></li><li><p>Create a new Scribe Analytics object, specifying the configuration options.</p><p><code>javascript
var scribe = new Scribe({tracker: myTracker});
</code></p></li><li><p>That&#39;s all! If your website supports login, you should also use the 
<code>Scribe.identify()</code> method. If you want to track custom events, you can use 
<code>Scribe.track()</code>.</p><p>While we recommend using <code>Scribe.identify()</code> to identify your users, in most
cases there is no need to manually track custom events.</p></li></ol>

<p>When you create the Scribe Analytics object, you must specify the configuration 
options. These options are detailed in the <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>When creating a Scribe Analytics object, the following options are supported:</p>

<ul><li><p><strong>tracker</strong> &amp;mdash; The tracker to use for storing data. See <a href="#trackers">Trackers</a> for more
information on this option.</p><p>This is a required field. There is no default.</p></li><li><p><strong>bucket</strong> &amp;mdash; Determines whether or not to include time information in the 
path where events are stored. Must be equal to &#39;none&#39;, &#39;daily&#39;, &#39;monthly&#39;, 
or &#39;yearly&#39;. If you choose <em>monthly</em>, for example, then events will be 
organized into paths that contain the year and month in which the event
occurred (e.g. &#39;/2013-12/&#39;).</p><p>The default for this option is &#39;none&#39;.</p></li><li><p><strong>breakoutUsers</strong> &amp;mdash; Determines whether or not to include user ID information
in the path where events are stored. If you set this field to <em>true</em>, then 
events for identified users will be organized into paths like &#39;/users/123/&#39;,
where 123 is a user ID.</p><p>The default for this option is <em>false</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>breakoutVisitors</strong> &amp;mdash; Determines whether or not to include visitor ID 
information in the path where events are stored. If you set this field to
<em>true</em>, then events for anonymous visitors will be organized into paths like
&#39;/visitors/123&#39;, where 123 is a visitor ID.</p><p>The default for this option is <em>false</em>.</p></li></ul>

<h2>Trackers</h2>

<p>The only option required to create a Scribe object is a <em>tracker</em>. A 
tracker is a function which accepts an object of the following form:</p>

<p><code>json
{
  &quot;path&quot;:    &quot;(A String)&quot;,
  &quot;value&quot;:   &quot;(A JSON Value)&quot;,
  &quot;op&quot;:      &quot;(Either &#39;replace&#39; or &#39;append&#39;)&quot;,
  &quot;success&quot;: &quot;(A success callback)&quot;,
  &quot;failure&quot;: &quot;(A failure callback)&quot;
}
</code></p>

<p>The <em>path</em> field contains information on how the data should be organized. The 
<em>value</em> field contains the raw data to store. Finally, the <em>op</em> field denotes
whether the data should replace the existing data at that path, or append to the
data stored at that path.</p>

<p>The <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em> fields, if present, are functions that should be 
called on success or failure, respectively.</p>

<p>In most cases, you won&#39;t have to create your own tracker because you can use
one of the supplied integrations (see <a href="#integrations">Integrations</a> below).</p>

<h3>Paths</h3>

<p>In Scribe Analytics, all data is organized into directories. Depending on the
backend you are using, these directories might be mapped into collections,
databases and tables, or files stored inside physical directories.</p>

<h1>Integrations</h1>

<p>Scribe Analytics contains a growing number of integrations. We welcome 
contributions from third-parties.</p>

<h2>Console</h2>

<p>The Console integration merely dumps information to the console. It&#39;s primary
use case is debugging or exploring the capabilities of Scribe Analytics.</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;scribe-console.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
...
var scribe = new Scribe(new ScribeConsoleTracker());
</code></p>

<h2>Precog</h2>

<p>The Precog integration dumps all information into the <a href="http://precog.com">Precog analytics store</a>,
where it can then be analyzed by <a href="http://labcoat.precog.com">Labcoat</a> or the Precog API.</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;scribe-precog.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
...
var scribe =  new Scribe(
                new ScribePrecogTracker({
                  apiKey:           apiKey, 
                  analyticsService: analyticsServiceUrl,
                  rootPath:         rootPath
                })
              );
</code></p>

<h2>Segment.IO</h2>

<p><em>Coming Soon</em> &amp;mdash; The Segment IO integration can direct data to a variety of 
different backends, which can be configured on the Segment IO dashboard.</p>
